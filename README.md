DarnTheLuck is my LaunchCode LiftOff project that I will use to demonstrate some of the programming skills I have learned.

DarnTheLuck is a computer repair shop ticketing system. Users are authenticated.
* Customers can create and view their own repair tickets. 
* Technicians can view and update customer tickets.
* Admins will be able to create, read, update and delete all tickets.

DarnTheLuck will use:
* C#
* JavaScript
* ASP.NET CORE / MVC
* Razor / HTML
* MySQL
* BootStrap / CSS
